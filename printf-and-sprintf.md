# Understanding printf()

The `printf()` function in PHP is used to output a formatted string. 

It uses placeholders within the string that are replaced by values provided in the function's arguments. 

The placeholders are marked by a percent sign (%) followed by a number and a type specifier.

For example, in `wp_nav_menu()`, the default for `items_wrap` is:

```php
?>
<ul id="%1$s" class="%2$s">%3$s</ul>
```
`%1$s` is a placeholder for the menu ID.

`%2$s` is a placeholder for the menu class.

`%3$s` is a placeholder for the list items.
