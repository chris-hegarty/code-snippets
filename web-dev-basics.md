Don’t feel like you have to watch the entire 11 hours!

* Chapters 1-5 Basics – Especially make sure you have the box model down! (margin, border, padding, content and box-sizing:border-box)
* Chapter 10 – Display – know the difference between block, inline, and inline-block elements.
* (Reference here: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp)
* Chapter 11  Floats – you will hopefully never have to write these, but you will run into them.
* Chapter 13 – Position - specifically position:relative and position:absolute, and how they work together. (You will run into this all the time.) 
* Chapter 14 Flexbox – Super important for layouts.
* Chapter 15 Grid – Not used as much as Flexbox, but a really powerful layout tool to be familiar with.

(For more in-depth learning on Flexbox and Grid, google Jen Simmons and/or Rachel Andrew…they are long-time developer advocates/educators who have made a ton of great tutorials on both.)

* Chapters 16 – Images – Pay close attention to background images. 
* Really learn and know the CSS background property – you’ll run into it often.
* CSS background property - https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_background.php

* Chapters 17, 19 – media queries, pseudo elements – important to know what the “:before” and “:after” elements do. You’ll see them often used to make overlays.

VS Code -  code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks – Download the keyboard shortcut sheet!! (Adobe 
Dreamweaver also has some really good shortcut sheets if you end up using that.)

Bootstrap - https://getbootstrap.com/ - Framework with CSS classes – Super handy, but can be confusing if you don’t already know CSS basics. It’s worth getting familiar with, because we use it in many of our projects.
