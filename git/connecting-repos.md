# Steps to Connect Local Version to Remote Repository

1. **Clone the Remote Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <remote-repo-url>
   cd <repository-name>

Add Your Local Project as a New Branch:
```git
cd <your-local-project-directory>
git init
```

Add the Remote Repository:

```
git remote add origin <remote-repo-url>
```


Fetch the Remote Repository:
```
git fetch origin
```
Create a New Branch from Your Local Project:
```
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of my local project"
```
Merge Remote Production Code:
```
git merge origin/main
```
Resolve Any Conflicts:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
```
Push Your Branch to the Remote Repository:
```
git push origin <your-branch-name>
```
