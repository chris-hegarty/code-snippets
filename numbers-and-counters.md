# Numbers and Counters

Counters are
-inherited from parents
-received from siblings.

You make a new counter with the `counter-reset` property. 

You can increment the counter with the `counter-increment` property. 

You display it with the `content` property. (on a pseudo element.)

Counters are directly set to a value using the `counter-set property`.
